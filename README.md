# Skip-List Data Structure

> For one of my class assignments, I was tasked with coding up a [Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list). the goal was to gain experience working with a probabilistic data structure and implementing reasonably complex insertion and deletion algorithms. 

## The Magic

```bash
# Compile this program with one of the test cases via cmd line
javac SkipList.java TestCase01.java

```
